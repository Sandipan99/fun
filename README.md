# fun
This repository consists of programs related to linked list, doubly linked list including reversing, binary search tree as 
well as some sample problems which I had done for fun. 
em_binomial is a C++ implementation of a expectation maximization algorithm for 2-dice problem
dice_face calculates the expected number of dice throws before each face is obtained at least once.

tic-tac-toe-bid is a new tic-tac-toe game that I have come across. two players can play this game. each player is initially give 100 chips. At each round each player 
submits a bid (less than current chip value). player with higher bid can only give his move in this round. but the bid amount will be subtracted from his chip value while the same amount being added to the loser. Enjoy!!

I keep on adding to this repository as I come across new interesting problems
