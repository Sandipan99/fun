# fun
This repository consists of programs related to linked list, doubly linked list including reversing, binary search tree as 
well as some sample problems which I had done for fun. 
em_binomial is a C++ implementation of a expectation maximization algorithm for 2-dice problem
dice_face calculates the expected number of dice throws before each face is obtained at least once.

I keep on adding to this repository as I come across new interesting problems
